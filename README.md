# Conway's Game of Life

A Simple Command Line Visualizer application for Conway's Game of Life.

The _Game of Life_, also known simply as _Life_, is a cellular automaton devised by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player
game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state,
requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an
initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and
can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
